### Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, unit tests are necessary to write. Currently we use Pytest as our testing framework and all test cases are written under the `tests` directory.

Some services may need extra dependencies to run tests. Example:

```
docker start test-redis || docker run --name test-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```

Run test cases with Poetry and Pytest:
```
poetry run pytest
```
